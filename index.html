          Latiné Legacy Month takes place from September 15 to October 15. The month includes the celebration of
          independence days of various Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
          Nicaragua, Mexico, and Chile. The month serves as a special occasion to celebrate the rich culture,
          contributions, and profound history of the Latiné community.</p>

        <p>For Latiné Legacy Month this year, The Phillipian reached out to some Latiné-identifying Andover students and
          faculty to ask about their thoughts on the month of celebration and their experiences with being Latiné at
          Andover.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">John Sanchez '23</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="longquote"> I think this month is like, it's about reflection. And just thinking back on how my Latino
          identity impacts me&#8230; I hear out where I'm from. I'm from Clifton, New Jersey, which happens to be a very
          predominant Latinx community. It's a very vibrant there. There's a huge presence of Peruvians. I'm Peruvian,
          so I feel very welcomed at Clifton, and I I do here too because I always try to carve out a space to represent
          my proven identity. Like in my dorm, I have my Peruvian flag. So it's like it's something I celebrate every
          day. And also just I have food from home. And I also like being the code of Alianza. Like I have that space to
          celebrate it, thankfully. And then also just like sharing some like cultural traditions with the dorm.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Mr. Hector Membreno-Canales</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="longquote">I know that Philips Academy isn't the only place celebrating this holiday. We have the
          great privilege of being just a couple miles away from communities that are predominantly Latinx: Lawrence,
          Haverhill, but also the greater Boston area. I myself was born in Honduras, and one of the largest communities
          of Honduran Americans in the United States is actually in Boston. So I'll likely be spending my time looking
          for these pop-up events in the area to go and be with community in Boston and Lawrence. I know that there is
          an upcoming Hispanic Heritage celebration weekend&#8230; There's no shortage of opportunities to get involved
          beyond our campus, so that's how I'll be celebrating.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">John Espinoza</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">I don't really celebrate it. But now that I'm here and I have a space where I can celebrate
          it&#8230;wherever there is the opportunity to speak about my culture, or represent it, I will. But in the
          past, I've never really thought about it. I wasn't aware of it. But now that I'm here with so many groups of
          people, I realized the importance of celebrating where I come from. So to me, it just reminds me of who I am,
          what I'm here for, and what I need to do on campus.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Angie Ceballos Cardona</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">This month means celebrating my history and future. I have taken this month to really
          reflect on what it means to be Latinx in the spaces I am in daily such as Andover and/or my sports team.</p>

        <h2 class="subheader">What has Andover done in the past for the Latine Legacy Month? What is Andover doing this year for the Latine Legacy Month?</h2><br>
        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Ben Perez '23</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="longquote"> I don't think the school has done a lot from what I've seen or recall. I think it's mostly Alianza Latina who's in charge of that. Maybe they hold something in Commons, but I don't think it was anything huge like&#8230; programming or anything like that&#8230;which... I would appreciate to see a lot more, just because [even though] there is [a Latine] community at Andover&#8230; I feel like, it's not as represented as it should be. It&rsquo;s not as seen as other affinity groups on campus, and they get mixed into other groups as well.</p>
      </p>
      
        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Mr. Hector Membreno-Canales</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">The first thing I'll mention is that Andover has responded to changes in language. One example is Hispanic Heritage Month, [which] is the national holiday prescribed by the federal government. But&#8230; after a couple of years of being here, I realized that the students of Alianza Latina didn't like Hispanic because Hispanic is only inclusive of the countries that speak Spanish. But in Latin America, there are other countries that don't speak Spanish. [The] more inclusive term was then Latino, but Latino fall short because [of] the gender binding, so then students preferred Latinx. But this year, students say [that] Latinx centers the conversation on English speakers, so now we're celebrating &ldquo;Latine-with-an-E&rdquo; Heritage Month&#8230; That&rsquo;s&#8230; one thing where I've seen students really kind of lead or direct the discussion and leadership within CAMD, within the school, with the administration sort of follow[ing] students&rsquo; lead.<br><br>
          A couple of other things: the OWHL has done an excellent job of supporting Alianza and the holiday by doing displays of books by Latine authors [&#8230;] Additionally [&#8230;] Paresky Commons have done things like making menus that are celebrating [Latine] culture. I mean, I'm sitting here eating frijoles and a Cuban sandwich&#8230;so there's a couple of ways.<br>
          [Also], we're bringing a renowned poet Jos&eacute; Olivarez. There are some posters that are in CAMD right now, but he'll come for ASM and&#8230; talk about his own story as a first-generation [Latine] person&#8230; He wrote a book called Citizen Illegal, [which] talks a bit about&#8230; what it's like to be in this country as an immigrant, as an undocumented person. And Andover is honoring those stories by really putting their money where their mouth is&#8230;not just saying we value this, but bringing these voices to our community to be heard, to share. You really can tell what Andover cares about by what they give space to so.</p>

        <h2 class="subheader">Alumni Narratives</h2>
        <p>We reached out to Andover alumni on Facebook with the following post:</p>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
          <div style="margin: -20px 10% 0 10%; line-height: 22px;">
            <p><em>Were you, a current Andover student, faculty member, or alumnae, present at the Women's March on
                Washington or a sister march elsewhere? <em>The Phillipian</em> would love to hear about your
                experiences at the march (including photos or videos), and reflections on how or if Andover prompted
                your interest in activism.</em></p>
          </div>
          <p>Below are a few of the narratives we received from alumnae who marched around the United States.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 style="font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 36px;">Boston</h3>
        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Abigail Burman ’12</h4>
        <div style="margin: -20px 0 0 5%; line-height: 22px;">
          <p>“I went to the big march in D.C., and it was absolutely overwhelming, people and pink hats in every
            direction, filling every street. There were so many people (2.5 times the initial estimate) that we ended up
            taking the inauguration parade route, and the stands that were so empty on the 20th were very full on the
            21st. This was the inauguration of a new era of democracy and patriotism, led by women, chanting ‘refugees
            are welcome here,’ and recognizing the necessity of asking tough questions. Movements can’t survive without
            hope and community, and we marched them both into existence, from towns of 200 to major cities. I’m so
            excited to see everyone keep up the organizing at the local level and in the midterms. With the care and
            dedication that coordinated buses from all across america and scoured the internet for security compliant
            clear plastic bags we are going to haul forth an America that embraces everyone.”</p>

            being excited at the spectacular turnout to being overwhelmed at the enormity of the challenges we face to
            feeling hopeful as the speakers galvanized the crowd. So thankful we were able to be part of such an
            historic day!”</p>

          <p>Me with current English teacher Dr. Vidal, who was one of my favorite teachers at Andover, at the post
            march Andover gathering at Trustee Gary Lee's restaurant. I hadn't realized Dr. Vidal would be at the march
            or gathering, but it was really exciting and fitting since she was the one who helped me realize that I was
            a feminist back in English 100 Junior year.</p>

            that I had the privilege to live with in Junior House, including Jane Tsai Weaver in CA, Jessica Gonzalez in
            Chicago, Dr. Allegra Cummings and Carolyn Bernal in NY, as well as Meredith Persily Lamel in MD.
             Unfortunately, I had to work Sat morning, but all these other women were at the march-- Jane was with her
            daughter in Cali, the rest all came to DC & Jess stayed with me.  Many of us were able to meet up after the
            march at the local Andover event hosted by Gary Lee.  It was a fantastic turnout that included Bobby
            Edwards.”</p>

            our president. But I loved John Palfrey's post-Election address, too—Andover and Wellesley have long
