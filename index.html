          Latiné Legacy Month takes place from September 15 to October 15. The month includes the celebration of
          independence days of various Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
          Nicaragua, Mexico, and Chile. The month serves as a special occasion to celebrate the rich culture,
          contributions, and profound history of the Latiné community.</p>

        <p>For Latiné Legacy Month this year, The Phillipian reached out to some Latiné-identifying Andover students and
          faculty to ask about their thoughts on the month of celebration and their experiences with being Latiné at
          Andover.</p>

        <p class="longquote"> I think this month is like, it's about reflection. And just thinking back on how my Latino
          identity impacts me&#8230; I hear out where I'm from. I'm from Clifton, New Jersey, which happens to be a very
          predominant Latinx community. It's a very vibrant there. There's a huge presence of Peruvians. I'm Peruvian,
          so I feel very welcomed at Clifton, and I I do here too because I always try to carve out a space to represent
          my proven identity. Like in my dorm, I have my Peruvian flag. So it's like it's something I celebrate every
          day. And also just I have food from home. And I also like being the code of Alianza. Like I have that space to
          celebrate it, thankfully. And then also just like sharing some like cultural traditions with the dorm.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="longquote">I know that Philips Academy isn't the only place celebrating this holiday. We have the
          great privilege of being just a couple miles away from communities that are predominantly Latinx: Lawrence,
          Haverhill, but also the greater Boston area. I myself was born in Honduras, and one of the largest communities
          of Honduran Americans in the United States is actually in Boston. So I'll likely be spending my time looking
          for these pop-up events in the area to go and be with community in Boston and Lawrence. I know that there is
          an upcoming Hispanic Heritage celebration weekend&#8230; There's no shortage of opportunities to get involved
          beyond our campus, so that's how I'll be celebrating.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">John Espinoza</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">I don't really celebrate it. But now that I'm here and I have a space where I can celebrate
          it&#8230;wherever there is the opportunity to speak about my culture, or represent it, I will. But in the
          past, I've never really thought about it. I wasn't aware of it. But now that I'm here with so many groups of
          people, I realized the importance of celebrating where I come from. So to me, it just reminds me of who I am,
          what I'm here for, and what I need to do on campus.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Angie Ceballos Cardona</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">This month means celebrating my history and future. I have taken this month to really
          reflect on what it means to be Latinx in the spaces I am in daily such as Andover and/or my sports team.</p>

        <h2 class="subheader">What has Andover done in the past for the Latine Legacy Month? What is Andover doing this
          year for the Latine Legacy Month?</h2><br>
        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Ben Perez '23</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="longquote"> I don't think the school has done a lot from what I've seen or recall. I think it's mostly
          Alianza Latina who's in charge of that. Maybe they hold something in Commons, but I don't think it was
          anything huge like&#8230; programming or anything like that&#8230;which... I would appreciate to see a lot
          more, just because [even though] there is [a Latine] community at Andover&#8230; I feel like, it's not as
          represented as it should be. It&rsquo;s not as seen as other affinity groups on campus, and they get mixed
          into other groups as well.</p>
        </p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Hector Membreno-Canales, Arts Instructor</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">The first thing I'll mention is that Andover has responded to changes in language. One
          example is Hispanic Heritage Month, [which] is the national holiday prescribed by the federal government.
          But&#8230; after a couple of years of being here, I realized that the students of Alianza Latina didn't like
          Hispanic because Hispanic is only inclusive of the countries that speak Spanish. But in Latin America, there
          are other countries that don't speak Spanish. [The] more inclusive term was then Latino, but Latino fall short
          because [of] the gender binding, so then students preferred Latinx. But this year, students say [that] Latinx
          centers the conversation on English speakers, so now we're celebrating &ldquo;Latine-with-an-E&rdquo; Heritage
          Month&#8230; That&rsquo;s&#8230; one thing where I've seen students really kind of lead or direct the
          discussion and leadership within CAMD, within the school, with the administration sort of follow[ing]
          students&rsquo; lead.<br><br>
          A couple of other things: the OWHL has done an excellent job of supporting Alianza and the holiday by doing
          displays of books by Latine authors [&#8230;] Additionally [&#8230;] Paresky Commons have done things like
          making menus that are celebrating [Latine] culture. I mean, I'm sitting here eating frijoles and a Cuban
          sandwich&#8230;so there's a couple of ways.<br>
          [Also], we're bringing a renowned poet Jos&eacute; Olivarez. There are some posters that are in CAMD right
          now, but he'll come for ASM and&#8230; talk about his own story as a first-generation [Latine] person&#8230;
          He wrote a book called Citizen Illegal, [which] talks a bit about&#8230; what it's like to be in this country
          as an immigrant, as an undocumented person. And Andover is honoring those stories by really putting their
          money where their mouth is&#8230;not just saying we value this, but bringing these voices to our community to
          be heard, to share. You really can tell what Andover cares about by what they give space to so.</p>

          I am one of the co-heads for Alianza Latinx&#8230; We do have a lot of events planned for this month. We
          screened a movie&#8230; Selena, which is about this&#8230; popstar or music superstar from the 90s by the same
          name Selena. We have&#8230; a school wide dance. It's open to everyone. It's&#8230;a really nice&#8230;
          combination of events just to&#8230; give space for our identity, [which is] sometimes &#8230;very hard to
          find&#8230; represented at Andover, especially not just in the midst of courses, but also trying to find
          representation&#8230; amongst the staff, or even just having spaces within our dorms&#8230; So&#8230; we give
          that space to ourselves, and we sometimes open it up to everyone on campus too.</p>

          I&#8230; like having those open door meetings [with Alianza, which] also helps bring this type of conversation
          [about Latinx Legacy Month] to a broader audience because I don't think many people stop and take the time to
          think about the difference between Hispanic and Latin[e] or what different forms of dance look like in
          different countries and things like that&#8230; I think that's a really good way to bring friends and be like,
          &ldquo;hey, this is my culture.&rdquo; It's kind of like a show and tell, [as] if we were in elementary or
          middle school but in a fancy, high school way, where it's like, &ldquo;this is my culture, appreciate it,
          learn about it.&rdquo; And obviously, everyone who goes [to open door meetings], is willing to engage in and
          indulge in that&#8230; so I always really enjoy [the dances and the open door meetings].</p>

          I am on the board of Alianza and as a team we are working really hard to give this month all the appreciation
          it deserves. Personally, I hope to put a lot of work in alongside the board to make this month so special to
          all the Latine students here at Andover just as it was to me last year.</p>

        <p class="longquote">
          Maybe it could be&#8230; a celebration&#8230; funded by the school, that way we could have more resources. Or
          it could be like a workshop, just talking about different cultures where people can explore&#8230;giv[ing]
          students a space to talk about the places they come from. [If it is] school organized&#8230; people will not
          only like take it more seriously, but [it would] also be interesting.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Ben Perez '23</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">
          I feel like the Spanish department has been trying to do a lot in that aspect. I feel like in general, in the
          US, the [Latine] community is kind of overlooked, so&#8230; that microcosm kind of&#8230; takes a role [at]
          Andover. I feel like people need to just embrace their culture more&#8230; and also&#8230; to the kids who are
          [Latine], don't try to like assimilate to be white. Like me, during the winter, I get really pale... so I
          could [assimilate], but someone who is Afro-Latino or Latina or Latinx couldn't. You just have to be able to
          bring [your identity] forward, and I try to bring [mine] forward as much as possible [through] the way that I
          dress, music&#8230; But sometimes it comes to a point where&#8230; you don't want to be just known that [way],
          like &ldquo;Oh that Bad Bunny kid.&rdquo; I don't want to be [just] that&#8230; It's like if &quot;El
          Jefe&quot; by El Alfa starts playing, everyone looks at me like, &ldquo;oh that's your song, bro.&rdquo; But
          it's&#8230; only my song if I say it's my song.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Hector Membreno-Canales, Arts Instructor</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">
          We celebrate these cultures because we value the diversity these communities bring to our Andover campus. But
          it's not simply enough to just learn one year and then that be like, Oh, now I know it all. These things like
          language and cultures and understandings are constantly evolving. So we really should be in continual
          discussion with each other, which is why this year, Latine feels authentic. Whereas last year Latinx felt
          authentic, and maybe in years past, Hispanic felt authentic, and who knows what next year will feel like but
          you know, the idea is to keep growing our diversity tent to include more folks.</p>

          it?</h2><br />

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Brigitte Leschhorn, English Instructor</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">
        Because I grew up in [Panama], I saw different types of what it means to be Central American, [what it means to
        be] Panamanian, what it means to be Latin[e]. And so I think [the question of whether we should use
        &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Latine&rdquo;] has a very complicated answer&#8230; A lot of times I feel like,
        especially during this month when we should be allowed to talk about it, nobody wants to hear it. Everyone just
        wants to hear &ldquo;who are your heroes,&rdquo; and they want to dismiss the parts of us that we&rsquo;re
        wrestling with. We're still deeply wrestling with the colonialism and imperialism that has decimated our
        regions&#8230; that has caused that major exodus of immigration. So all of these things touch&#8230; And just
        even with what happened from Florida to Massachusetts recently&#8230;a lot of things are in the forefront of my
        mind&#8230; It's not that I don't want to celebrate our history; it's that our history is really complicated.
        And can we at least get some time to talk about it? To me, that's what this month should be about: a time to
        unpack that. Give us some time to unpack ourselves.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Angie Ceballos Cardona</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">
        It&rsquo;s important to know that it is okay to not be informed and that questions should be asked. There is no
        specific approach to Latinx Legacy Month but to recognize the latine voices around you because they are a part
        of Andover life.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Josh Espinoza '25</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">
        If people are curious to learn more about somebody's culture, I think it should be a safe space to talk about
        anything&#8230; I don't think it's rude to ask somebody about their culture&#8230; It's okay if you want to
        learn more about who I am where I'm from. That's perfectly fine&#8230; Andover is already a space where I can
        express myself, but I also feel like we should be able to have open conversations about different cultures and
        how they're represented on campus.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">John Sanchez</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">
        I think I really want to emphasize that it's not heritage. Tt is about legacy. I think that's what it's
        about&#8230; I think [when] people view Latin[e] people&#8230; they have a certain image that comes to their
        mind&#8230; That has to be confronted&#8230; We're not just a monolith&#8230; We all don't have just brown skin.
        We don't all have like baggy clothing, chains just wrapped around our neck all the time, [and] even though I
        [do], we all don't speak Spanish&#8230;There are so many more things are just confined to a stereotype...
        Really, it's not just something that's interpersonal. It's something that's structuralized&#8230;.I&rsquo;m
        thinking of&#8230;trying to make that effort to prioritize perspectives that come from Latin[e] people and
        within that diaspora, like you could have indigenous Latin[e] people, black Latin[e] people, Indigenous
        Afro-Latin[e] people&#8230; There's, there's a whole spectrum. It's not just brown. That makes it very much
        simplistic, and really just erases the whole legacy of everything.</p>

        <p class="longquote">
        I would just say that these are holidays. We celebrate them because some of these voices historically have not
        been heard. So I would use this as an opportunity if you're unfamiliar with these communities, to use it as an
        opportunity to go to events and ask some questions. And to just you know, be a member of our very diverse
        community.

            taking the inauguration parade route, and the stands that were so empty on the 20th were very full on the
            21st. This was the inauguration of a new era of democracy and patriotism, led by women, chanting ‘refugees
            are welcome here,’ and recognizing the necessity of asking tough questions. Movements can’t survive without
            hope and community, and we marched them both into existence, from towns of 200 to major cities. I’m so
            excited to see everyone keep up the organizing at the local level and in the midterms. With the care and
            dedication that coordinated buses from all across america and scoured the internet for security compliant
            clear plastic bags we are going to haul forth an America that embraces everyone.”</p>

            being excited at the spectacular turnout to being overwhelmed at the enormity of the challenges we face to
            feeling hopeful as the speakers galvanized the crowd. So thankful we were able to be part of such an
            historic day!”</p>

          <p>Me with current English teacher Dr. Vidal, who was one of my favorite teachers at Andover, at the post
            march Andover gathering at Trustee Gary Lee's restaurant. I hadn't realized Dr. Vidal would be at the march
            or gathering, but it was really exciting and fitting since she was the one who helped me realize that I was
            a feminist back in English 100 Junior year.</p>

          <p>“Hello, I graduated from Andover in 1990 and have stayed in touch all these years with many of the women
            that I had the privilege to live with in Junior House, including Jane Tsai Weaver in CA, Jessica Gonzalez in
            Chicago, Dr. Allegra Cummings and Carolyn Bernal in NY, as well as Meredith Persily Lamel in MD.
             Unfortunately, I had to work Sat morning, but all these other women were at the march-- Jane was with her
            daughter in Cali, the rest all came to DC & Jess stayed with me.  Many of us were able to meet up after the
            march at the local Andover event hosted by Gary Lee.  It was a fantastic turnout that included Bobby
            Edwards.”</p>

          <p>“Hi there — Class of ’92 on the march in N.Y.C. Many Andover pals marched as well, but I went with some
            Wellesley sisters (and Allison Williams). I worked hard for Hillary, and am still heartbroken that she's not
            our president. But I loved John Palfrey's post-Election address, too—Andover and Wellesley have long
            traditions of service, and I aim to uphold them as a citizen.”</p>
